Headless WordPress theme is clean, pixel-perfect and grid-based. Since content is king, the 'header' is placed at the bottom leaving more content above the fold.

Version: 0.9.2

WHAT YOU NEED TO MODIFY:

* headless_portrait.jpg should be replaced with your own mugshot or similar picture, ideally with a background of #333 and height of 162px. If you don't want a picture, you can just delete headless_portrait.jpg from the images folder, or better yet, remove the background image from style.css #footer #footercontainer.

* The paragraph of introductory copy in the sidebar should be replaced to suit you, or removed. This can be found in sidebar.php on line 3.

* If you feel that you want to remove the theme details from the footer, please consider leaving it. Perhaps you could just change the anchor color to make it less prominent.

DESIGN:

An 18px grid is used for aesthetic purposes. It is strictly adhered to on the vertical axis, and generally adhered to on the horizontal axis. Modifications will have the best result if all sizes (particularly line heights) are kept as multiples of 18. Notice that this can be a bit tricky when divs have borders (so for example where there's a 1px border, padding/margin should be 17/35/53 px).

I haven't styled the calendar, so you should style this before you use it.

Oh, and I've only tested the theme on WordPress versions 2.5 and 2.6, on standards-compliant browsers.
